 <h1>About</h1>
ATLiER is a web3.0 powered e-commerce website that lets you browse items in 3D.
Users can skip through the worrying phase of whether or not a 
product will be 'as it is in the picture'. It's a surefire way of ensuring
that customers get exactly what they ordered. Merchants can use 
our technology and upload 3D models of their product.

<h1>How it works?</h1>
As of now, we use Apple's RealityKit for photogrammetry to make 3D models out of scanned images.
Essentially we want an entire blockchain based ecosystem of goods that are being bought and sold.
